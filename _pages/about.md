Hello!

I’m Tianyi Huang (Gwins7), a Master’s student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS). I’m part of the Security Group in the Architecture Laboratory at the Center for Advanced Computer Systems (ACS), where I work under the guidance of  [Prof. Mingyu Chen](https://asg.ict.ac.cn/cmy/english/). My research focuses on Computer Architecture, HW/SW Codesign with FPGA, and Processor Security Mechanisms. While I primarily work with C, Verilog, and Chisel, I’m also exploring Rust.

You can follow our latest research progress on [Our Group's Github Page](https://github.com/orgs/DASICS-ICT). We’re developing DASICS (Dynamic in-Address-Space Isolation by Code Segments), a processor security mechanism for [Xiangshan](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan), an open-source, high-performance RISC-V processor. This is currently my main project.

This homepage is still under construction, so please feel free to follow my GitHub or contact me via email for more details!
